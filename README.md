# Casual minesweeper

[Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_%28video_game%29) "as it should be", and by that I mean what it would look and feel, was it designed today with web technologies and new savoir-faire in UX.

## Early versions

1. `minesweeper_dom.html` used to store data about the cells directly in the DOM.
2. `minesweeper_beforeData.html` is snapshot, before the [jQuery](jquery.com) update which made `.data()` available.

## Current features

## Trivia
